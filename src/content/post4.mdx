You can find PMPs leading projects in nearly every country and, unlike other certifications that focus on a particular geography or domain, the PMP® is truly global. As a PMP, you can work in virtually any industry, with any methodology and in any location.
The PMP can also provide a significant advantage when it comes to salary and earning potential. Among survey respondents to PMI’s Earning Power Salary Survey, those with a PMP certification garner a higher salary (20% higher on average) than those without a PMP certification.
Employers benefit as well. According to the PMI Pulse of the Profession® study when more than one-third of their project managers are PMP-certified, organizations complete more of their projects on time, on budget and meeting original goals. (Pulse of the Profession® study, PMI, 2015.)
The PMP signifies that you speak and understand the global language of project management and connects you to a community of professionals, organizations and experts worldwide. 
This course will provide learners with the understanding of essential PMBOK® terminology, tools and techniques required to plan and manage a large project to international best practice standards. 
This course together with intense learning over a period of 10 weeks will prepare the delegate to write and pass the PMP exam and become an internationally accredited Project Manager.
